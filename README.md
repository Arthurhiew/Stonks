In the last decade, the number of retail investors have increased tremendously thanks to the democratization of the stock market and apps such as Robinhood that allows “normal” people to invest into the stock market easily. However, most retail investors are not educated about the stock market and solely invest based on hype. This app aims to use the Discounted Cash Flow method to predict the intrinsic value of a company and identify whether the company is undervalued or not. However, the user of this app should keep in mind that they should not follow the calculations blindly and this app is by no means a financial advisor.
